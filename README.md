WinchRack_Type2 for ERCF buffer 



v6cl (방탄쪼끼) is a nice member of the same country and Voron User kakao chat room. He is adept at design and has helped shortcomings in the multi-color ERCF buffer, for which we are grateful. Building upon his design, I have received wonderful ideas to modify the structure for improved spatial aspects and easier spool install.
